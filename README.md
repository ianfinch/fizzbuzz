# FizzBuzz Coding Challenge

Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100, but gor each
multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, for each multiple of 5,
print "Buzz" instead of the number, and for numbers which are multiples of both
3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
